This version of Catapult, the 0.1 was released in the beginning of 2008.

This PHP framework wasn't made for replace the major ones, but a test to see what I was able to create.

Catapult works well (didn't benched it though), but it's not really usefull for creating websites.
The core is here and fully functionnal, but all the dependencies, like ORM, Form maker, User and Permissions, ACL, haven't been implemented.

A new version is on its way, more oriented RESTful with tons of improvment, mainly on the load and memory usage.
You'll find more about it in the README file located in the trunk folder.

For your information, here's what this v0.1 can do :

x MVC architecture
x Database access based on a abstracted layer
    o Allow the developer to keep is main code while changing the database engine
